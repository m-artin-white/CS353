This is the folder the Team Fight Tactics API. I have included functionality for displaying two Summoner's data and 
the comparison between them using a button that will display when fields for each player is filled in. I will send a video onto the groupchat on Microsoft Teams
later on demonstrating how everything works for the app. 
You don't need to worry about how the backend works for now. Just work on making the frontend. I have given an ID to most of the objects in the HTML file, so you should
be able to access them right away from the styles.css file. All the files are already linked. 
If you have any issues send me a message on whatsapp and I can explain my code better, but there should be comments there to explain all parts of the code.
