Hello, 

Welcome to our project for CS353. You will find everything you need to run our app within this folder. You will also need to set up an account with Riot Games to use our app. A 24-hour access key is required in order to retrieve user information. This key can then be obtained through the Riot Game's Developer Portal. This key can then be copied into the both files "stat-tracker -> LOL -> scriptLOL.js" and then paste it within "var API_key" and save your file. Similarly, this should be done in "stat-tracker -> TFT -> scriptTFT.js" within "var API_key".

Thank you. If you have any feedback please email statssummoner@gmail.com.

Enjoy, 

Martin and Team.
