Hey guys, 
you can check out what I've done to the front end for the TFT part. I also created the "home" page where you can select which game 
you want to use. I uploaded a short video on Teams of me using the api and you can also check it out by downloading the folder. 
Just make sure everything is in the right folder and then just host a local server from the "home.hmtl" file.
